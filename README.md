# Tailscale GQL API

This is an under development GraphQL API for Tailscale's API v2 .

# Goals

* learn :)
* Be able to query a big fleet of tailscale nodes (with pagination and filters)
* Query for specific GQL types fast on an environment with very low resources
* Subscribe to patterns in order to monitor changes
* Monitor more than one tailscale network


# Future Goals

* Create a flexible Access Control GUI that uses device info for preview


Ideas and help are more than welcome as this is something I'm working only on my free Sundays.
